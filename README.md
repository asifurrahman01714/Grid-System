# Grid-System

1. At first you have to style as display: grid to design your layout according to grid system.
2. Add grid-template-columns and rows. where the pixel is the width for columns and height for rows
3. We can add grid row and column gap by grid-row-gap and grid-column-gap
4. For same gap in row and column write grid-gap only
5. For responsive pixel is disgusting. So use fraction unit like-
            grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;  
            grid-template-rows: 1fr 2fr;
